# Star Destroyer

## Overview

Welcome to the **Star Destroyer** project! This React application is designed to help practice using the powerful hooks `useEffect` and `useRef`. The goal is to create an interactive space environment where stars are generated randomly in the viewport every 2.5 seconds, and users can destroy these stars by clicking on them.

## Features

- **Star Generation:** Stars are generated at random positions within the viewport every 2.5 seconds.
- **Star Destruction:** Click on a star to destroy it and remove it from the screen.
- **Focus Effect:** Each star is automatically focused upon creation, with a visual indication such as a shadow.
